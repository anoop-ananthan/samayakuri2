# samayakuri2

An application to learn the features of flutter.

## Objective

The main objective is to show the punch logs and timing information of users from the API `http://------.net/index.php?r=punchresult/DailyPunchApi`. It also allow to compute current tasks time and make sure that 8 hours of each work day is accounted correctly.

## This branch

This branch is protected. I started off using `Provider` for the store. But, I find it cumborsome. After searching through the net, I find `MobX` to be more "friendlier" :lol: Therefore, all the progress using `Provider` is halted and new changes are incorporated using `MobX`. This branch is for documentation only.
